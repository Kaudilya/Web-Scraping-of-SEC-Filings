# Web Scraping of SEC Filings
 Developed code for webscraping of SEC filing documents. This can be used to retrieve the footnotes present in a filing only if it has a particular term needed [Eg: side pocket, gate]

Example:
In an SEC filing, if the footnote has the term 'side pocket' in it, this program helps to retrieve that footnote alone.
